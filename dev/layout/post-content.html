            <p>Intelligently crafted interiors, efficient performance, functional operation, and premium style. That’s the best way to describe the luxury that is an Audi. From their trademark Quattro AWD system to the four linked rings in the emblem, Audi has developed a fantastic reputation for luxury at a competitive price. It’s competitive pricing that also happens to apply to used Audis in Ontario, Canada.</p>
            <p>The starting price for a new Audi A3 sedan, the most economical in the lineup, begins at $34,500 and goes up quickly from there. But you’re in luck, because you can get an Audi car or SUV for under $30,000 with Carnance. Here are five examples of the best used Audis under $30,000.</p>
            <p><a href="#">2016 – 2017 Audi A4 Sedan</a></p>
            <p>One of the bestselling premium sedans, the Audi A4 destroys the competition in terms of value. Standard features in the A4 include sporty 17-inch wheels, sunroof, cruise control, tri-zone climate control, power adjustable seats, and leather upholstery. Bluetooth phone capability, navigation, and a 10 or 14 speaker sound system are available for its 6.5-inch display. Blind Spot Monitor, parking sensors, and Wi-Fi hotspotting are also available.</p>
            <p>For a sedan, the A4 looks quite graceful and sporty too. It packs a 220-hp turbocharged 2.0L engine under the hood and is available with a 6-speed manual or 8-speed automatic transmission for efficient yet spirited performance, not to mention it’s available in Quattro AWD. All in all, you can get a 2016 to 2017 Audi A4 sedan from around $16,000 and up and still<a href="#">get competitive Audi financing rates</a></p>
            <p><a href="#">2016 – 2017 Audi A5 Coupe</a></p>
            <p>Whether you want a fun two-door car for weekend drives or a stylish business commuter, the Audi A5 coupe is a fantastic option. Gorgeous 18-inch alloys underpin the sleek silhouette while HID headlights and LED accent lighting make it stand out. The A5 comes standard with a panoramic roof, supple leather upholstery on well-bolstered heated front seats, Bluetooth, 10 speaker audio, and Audi’s tri-zone climate control.</p>
            <p>As you go up through the trim levels, additional features are available, such as front and rear parking sensors navigation, active damping suspension, and so on. It’s extremely efficient on fuel while giving you a fun ride with its 220-hp 2.0L engine and Quattro AWD with your choice of 6-speed manual or 8-speed auto gearbox.<br/>A three or four-year-old model will cost around the low $20k’s, giving you access to<a href="#">amazing Audi car finance deals with convenient payments</a></p>
            <p><a href="#">2017 – 2018 Audi A3 Sedan</a></p>
            <p>If something more budget conscious is more your speed, consider the Audi A3 sedan. Although the A3 is available as a Sportback too, the abundance of sedans will keep them priced more affordably. You certainly don’t feel like you’re giving anything up, though, since standard equipment includes dual climate control, panoramic sunroof, Bluetooth, 17-inch alloy wheels, and leather upholstery. If you feel like getting a few more options, such as Bang & Olufsen sound, navigation in a 7-inch screen, LED headlights, or the E-Tron hybrid trim, you’ll probably need to stretch your budget above $30,000.</p>
            <p>The A3 keeps it price-conscious with the option of just front-wheel drive with its 2.0L turbo I-4 engine and dual-clutch transmission, but a Quattro AWD-equipped model is probably best in the Great White North. For a two or three-year-old model,<a href="#">you’ll be looking at the low to mid-$20K range</a></p>
            <p><a href="#">2016 – 2017 Audi Q5 SUV</a></p>
            <p>The Q5 is the midsize SUV in the Audi lineup. It is a spacious five-seater with brilliant views from every vantage point, inside and out. A power liftgate is an ideal convenience feature in the elegant SUV’s tall design, and Audi’s Pre Sense Basic and Pre-Sense City driver assist features help keep you and your occupants safe inside. Leather upholstery, push-button ignition, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, tri-zone climate control, and a 10-speaker sound system with 7-inch in-dash display are all standard features.</p>
            <p>Elevate the experience with options like a head-up display, 12-inch digital cluster, navigation, and 19 speakers, plus a panoramic sunroof and heated front seats that are perfect for driving in Ontario, Canada. The Q5 can be powered by either a 252-hp 2.0L turbo four-cylinder or a 354-hp twin-turbocharged V6. In either case you’ll be extremely happy with performance, especially as all Q5 models have standard Quattro AWD.</p>
            <p>Depending on the year and mileage, a used Q5 SUV can be found in the under $30,000 price range Furthermore, a 2017 model will still have access to longer Audi finance terms,<a href="#"> helping to keep your payments low</a></p>
            <p><a href="#">2015 – 2016 Audi A7 Sportback</a></p>
            <p>Sexy and mysterious, the Audi A7 Sportback has a long, eye-catching outline that’s going to command attention. As a luxury hatchback in the midsize segment, you’ll get tons of space for passengers and cargo and a plethora of standard features. All A7 models include crystal-clear LED headlights, four-zone climate control, navigation, leather upholstery, head-up display, and a symphonic 14-speaker Bose surround sound system. Ventilated front seats come standard along with multi-setting heat as well. The options are limitless as you go up the range including up to 21-inch wheels, an S-line Sport package, Dynamic Ride Control, and much more.</p>
            <p>Under the hood, the A7 comes with your choice of supercharged 3.0L V6 for 333hp or a slightly more fuel efficient 3.0L turbocharged diesel V6 with 240hp. All models have Audi’s Quattro AWD system as standard, and you’ll need the traction.</p>
            <p><a href="#">You can buy a used Audi A7 as it sneaks into the $30K price range</a>if you’re willing to consider a few extra kilometers on the dial and a car that’s four or five years old. It shouldn’t be a problem since reliability isn’t an issue for Audi.</p>
            <p><a href="#">2016 – 2017 Audi Q3 SUV and Audi Q5 SUV</a></p>
            <p>Another popular choice for car shoppers buying a used Audi under $30K is the Q3 SUV. Built very much like the A3 sedan in terms of options and powertrain, it gives the driver more interior space and a higher perspective behind the wheel.</p>
            <p>The Premium trim comes with the entry level and offers HID headlights, leather upholstery, panoramic sunroof, and front and rear parking sensors as standard equipment. All trims use the same 2.0L I-4 turbo engine with 200-hp and a six-speed transmission, and Quattro AWD is also an available option for this model.<br/>For a model around three years old,<a href="#">you can get a good payment deal with Audi financing</a> on a vehicle that will likely run you in the high $20K range.</p>
